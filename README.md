# Video Motion Analysis
 
## Abstract
A personal project involves tracking the motion of small objects (and only small objects), when the whole frame could be moving with some rotational velocity and acceleration that is known to a high degree of accuracy. The purpose of this project is to implement, optimize, and evaluate the performance of various methods that could extract "unexpected" motion within the frame that is not accounted for by the known movement of the camera, thereby extracting the desired movement information of the small objects.

## Objectives
- Implement methods to extract movement from stationary-camera videos by looking at pixel differences
- Implement methods to extract unexpected movement from constant-velocity-camera videos
- Determine approaches suitable for the actual high level goal described in the abstract, and implement them

## Roadmap
- Implement semi-robust and highly performant approach to loading videos and image sequences from files
- Address the first objective
- Expand roadmap based on ambitions
